Choose <u>modern</u> technologies that exercise the breadth of approach and
ones that you’re comfortable developing with.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Create a responsive (phone, tablet, desktop) web
application that allows the user to quick filter a list of things. The top of
the page will have a search input field and then below that a list of things in
response to the filter. The things should be sorted alphabetically. The things could
be anything, but should be AJAX pulled from a backend service that you write
and should ultimately be pulled from an open public API.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here’s an example list of <span class=GramE>API’s</span>
curated on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis">https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis</a>
but feel free to use any public API you wish.</p>
